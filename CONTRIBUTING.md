# Contributing to Engram

Thanks for considering a contribution to Engram — the AI identity layer that stores who you are, not just what you did.

## Architecture Overview

```

Key design principles:
- **100% local by default** — opt-in local telemetry only (no network in Phase 1), no cloud
- **User-owned data** — all knowledge stored as human-readable JSON files
- **MCP-native** — every capability exposed as an MCP tool or resource
- **Privacy by default** — trust boundaries, encryption at rest, safe profile filtering

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Patdolitse/engram.git
cd engram
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Requires Python 3.10+. The optional `[secure]` extra adds encryption support, `[remote]` adds SSE transport.

## Running Tests

```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Current baseline: **490+ tests, 0 failures, 83%+ coverage**. All PRs must maintain this.

For retrieval quality benchmarks (requires test data setup):
```bash
python experiments/benchmarks/round10_retrieval_quality/run_round10.py --group t1
```

## Code Guidelines

- **Python 3.10+** — use type hints where they add clarity
- **Keep changes focused** — one concern per PR
- **Readable over clever** — three similar lines beat a premature abstraction
- **Test behavioral changes** — add or update tests when logic changes
- **No external calls** — Engram must never phone home or make network requests in core operations
- **Bilingual content** — user-facing strings should support both Chinese and English

## Security Guidelines

Engram handles sensitive personal data. Extra care is required:

- **Never `eval()` or `exec()` user data**
- **HTML output must use `_esc()` for all user-controlled values** (XSS prevention)
- **All identity update methods validate against field whitelists** — don't bypass this
- **Trust boundaries (`restricted_fields`) must be respected** in any new data exposure path
- **Encryption** — sensitive profile fields (email, phone, etc.) are encrypted at rest; don't add fields to `ENCRYPTED_PROFILE_FIELDS` without review
- **Report vulnerabilities privately** — see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

## Commit Messages

Follow the pattern: `type: short description`

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `security`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `refactor`

Examples:
```
feat: add domain-based lesson filtering
fix: prevent XSS in review page domain titles
security: enforce trust boundaries in identity card export
```

## Pull Requests

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. Make your changes with tests
4. Run the full test suite — all 490+ tests must pass
5. Open a PR explaining **what** changed and **why**

PR titles should be under 70 characters. Use the description for details.

## Reporting Issues

Please include:
- Operating system and Python version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Engram version (`pip show piia-engram`)

**Security vulnerabilities**: Do NOT open a public issue. Email engram-security@proton.me instead.
